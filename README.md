# functional-refactorings

**Intent**
A plethora of functional programming material exists online today, yet little if any of this material explains <em>why</em> you would want to use these functional techniques. Often this educational material starts with the what and how, and does not answer the why and when. This project intends to reverse this order, limiting the depth of the what/how to only what is necessary as to not discourage or confuse the consumers of this project.

This project considers readability and testability as the greatest benefits (both business and technical) of declarative and functional programming. Thus, in order to explain the why and when of this style, the pre-refactored codebase contained within the repository is written in what is largely the opposite style - imperative.

**Description**
The repository here contains one application in two separate coding styles: one in a more imperative style of writing JavaScript, and the other a refactored version of the former in a more declarative and functional style. This project is intended to be didactic, thus key to note here is the importance of practicality over purity; the refactored version is not entirely purely functional nor purely declarative, nor is the original version entirely imperative.
